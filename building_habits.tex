\chapter{Building Habits}

The main steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Choose the correct habit to install.} What problem are you trying to
	solve by building this habit? What improvement do you want to make? Why do you
	want to solve that problem/make that improvement? 
	\item \text{\textbf{Eliminate as many barriers to building the habit as you can}}. If you are
	trying to eat more healthily, then throw out all the junk food in your house. If you
	want to set up certain study periods, get the TV  out of your room. 
	\item \textbf{Minimise conscious effort required}. Minimise the amount of conscious 
	effort required to perform the habit. If you need to study regularly, put the sessions
	in your calendar and have your phone remind you. If you want to eat less, eat off smaller 
	plates and cook smaller portions. Have the necessary equipment ready and easily accessible.
	\item \textbf{(Optional) Set up a reward}. 
	\item \textbf{Implement the smallest version of that habit}.  
\end{enumerate}
