## Description
This is a small ebook project in which I am trying to help upper high school
and undergraduate students learn more effectively and get the most out of their
schools. 

The project is in its infancy, with most of the content living only in my head.
You will thus find errors of all varieties from unclear statements to organisational flaws. I have also not bothered with much typesetting yet.
However, if you happen to find something useful in this book, or
have a suggestion or comment, please email me at alex.hs.lee@gmail.com.
